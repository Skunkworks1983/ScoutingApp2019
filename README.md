ScoutingApp2019

This repo is a collection of the tools written and used by the Skunk Works Robotics team (frc1983)

The tools (still a work in progress) are:
- The main scouting app, used for collective quantitative data from competitions. We use AWS cloud storage to store the data and Tableau for analysis
- The match schedule viewer, which uses the TBA API to display the match schedule for the given competition.
- The manual match schedule input tool, for the competitions TBA doesn't have a match schedule for
- The scout meeting tool, to streamline the process of match prediction at the end of the first day of a competition
